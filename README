Access the Rally API using python.

Currently it provides READ ONLY access to some of the API provided by
Rally.

At the top level, the client can be used to:
    * get all the entities in Rally
    * get all stories/defects in a kanban state in rally
    * get a story/task by name

Or, by importing the model objects, it is possible to:
    * get all stories/tasks/defects/iterations/user in Rally
    * get a story/task/defect/iteration/user by name
